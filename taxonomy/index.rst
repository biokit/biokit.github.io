Taxonomy - the science of classifying organisms
====================================================

Organisms have common and scientific name but all organisms have only 1 scientific name (usually Latin or Greek) 
developed by Carolus Linnaeus. Scientific names follow a specific set of rules and a two-name system called a  **Binomial Nomenclature**. The first word 
indicates the *Genus*  and the second word indicates the *species*. The first word is capitalized and the second is not. For example *Homo sapiens*.


The taxonomy way of classifying organism is based on similarities between different organisms.
Linneaus also createdd a system to organize animals using large groups divided in subgroups. These subgroups are ::

    Kingdom -  Phylum - Class - Order - Family - Genus - Species
    
For instance, for *Homo sapiens* we have these names for each group::

    Animalia - Chordata - Mammalia - Primate - Homindae -  Homo - sapiens
 

    
Kingdom
---------
There are currently 6 kingdoms. Organisms are placed into their kingdoms based on hte number and type of 
cells they have (and nutritional needs).

The kingdoms are archaebacteria, eubacteria, fungae, plantae, animalia, protista.
