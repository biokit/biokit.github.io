Taxonomy - the science of classifying organisms
====================================================

Organisms have common and scientific name but all organisms have only 1 scientific name (usually Latin or Greek) 
developed by Carolus Linnaeus. This **Binomial Nomenclature** write an organism name in italic with the first word 
indicating the *Genus* (capitalized) and the second word indicating the *species* (lowercase). For example *Homo sapiens*.

Linneaus also createdd a system to organize animals using large groups divided in subgroups. These subgroups are ::

    Kingdom -  Phylum - Class - Order - Family - Genus - Species
    
For instance, for *Homo sapiens* we have these names for each group::

    Animalia - Chordata - Mammalia - Primate - Homindae -  Homo - sapiens
    
Kingdom
---------
There are currently 6 kingdoms. Organisms are placed into their kingdoms based on hte number and type of 
cells they have (and nutritional needs).

The kingdoms are archaebacteria, eubacteria, fungae, plantae, animalia, protista.
